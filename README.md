# Corona Scraper

Build a simple webscraper that scrapes a set of documents from the internet and summarises them using gensim.

If you manage to achieve this, extract keywords from all the different documents and see if any are more popular than others. Search for documents that contain those keywords using Python and then summarise those documents too.
